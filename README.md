# Data-Analysis
### End to end data analysis projects using Python
Nurses are the first line of defense in terms of general population interaction with healthcare services. The supply and demand trends for nursing staff vary depending on population needs, regulations and policies of the state, as well as on federal level and can vary from year to year. 
In this project I go over the results of my analysis, reviewing nursing jobs salary and overtime paid by City and County of San Francisco, 2013 - 2018, in order to determine if there is an increase in mean salary and overtime earned. Is there a significant increase in overtime independent of salaries? 
If yes, this would mean there is a growing need for nursing staff and it could have greater impact on future hiring, budget planning and quality of service provided in this demanding field.

# Set Up

This data is summarized and presented on the Employee Compensation report hosted at http://openbook.sfgov.org, and is also available in this dataset in CSV format. New data is added on a bi-annual basis when available for each fiscal and calendar year.

## Analysis Purpose:

My goal is to review Nursing jobs salary and overtime over the 6 year period (from 2013 to 2018) in order to determine if there is an increase in mean salary earned, as well if there is an increase in overtime earned. I specifically want to test and determine if the increase in overtime is greater then increase in salary, as this would show growing need for nursing staff and could have greater impact on future hiring, budget planning and quality of service provided in this demanding field.
